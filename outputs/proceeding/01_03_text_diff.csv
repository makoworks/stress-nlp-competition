"Hearing Songs It can be nearly impossible to go from angry to happy, so youare just looking for the thought that eases you out of your angry feeling and moves you in the direction of happiness. It may take a while, but as long as youare headed in a more positive direction youall be doing yourself a world of good.","Hearing Songs It can be nearly impossible to go from angry to happy, so you're just looking for the thought that eases you out of your angry feeling and moves you in the direction of happiness.

 GRA, Uttar Pradesh, India a As soon as my train to Agra leaves from Delhi, I find myself confused again. Iam lying on my reserved upper berth, though most of the train car beds arenat being used and almost all of the passengers are sitting on lower seats. I feel ridiculous, like Iam emperor of my train car, overseeing the rest of the passengers from above. Meanwhile, men pass by below me, offering a mysterious vegetarian curry out of industrial-sized buckets. I motion for one to serve me some on a paper plate, but when I try to pay for the food, he wonat accept any money. This is the first time Iave gotten anything for free in India. I conclude that the food is going to kill me.
 
 
 
 While Iam eating, the train makes a stop and passengers disembark, but the conductor makes no announcements. I canat see through any of the trainas tiny lower windows from my upper bunk. I have no idea where I am.
 
 
 
 aIs this Agra?a I ask a man sitting below me. I ask as nicely as possible, in an attempt to avoid appearing as a self-righteous train car emperor, shouting questions to my serfs. After all, I remember, Taj Mahal-builder and Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son soon after the Taj Mahalas completion. The man below shakes his head and, in Hindi, I think he tells me that we still have a long ride to Agra. Another man walks by selling non-vegetarian food in foil tins. The first shots of an intestinal war have already been fired as a result of my free bucket food, so I decline. As the train chugs toward Agra, stopping at stations along the way, I find myself continuously recruiting new serfs below me to keep track of where we are. By the time Iam halfway through the journey, I have an eighteen year old kid, two Indian soldiers, and a young woman a none of whom can speak English a trying to assist me. Itas easy to accidentally aggregate helpers on the train; mercifully, Indians tend to be especially protective of clueless Westerners trying to make sense of Indian public transportation. At one point, the two Indian soldiers demand that a teenager move his feet resting on my berth, and the young woman makes food recommendations as buckets whisk by. Theyare kind of like four Train-Fairy Godmothers. Soon, I fall asleep.
 
 
 
 Suddenly, I awake to the sound of four Indians chanting aAgra! Agra!a in unison. I abruptly end my time as train car emperor, jump down from my bed, thank the four of them, and catch a taxi to my Agra guesthouse. Before he leaves, I arrange for my taxi driver to pick me up at 6 AM the next morning to take me to the Taj Mahal.
 
 
 
 In the morning, I tell my driver to take me to the East Gate of the Taj Mahal. He promptly takes me to a roundabout near the West Gate instead a though his aEast Gate!a announcement upon our arrival is quite convincing. Indiaas perpetually dishonest taxi drivers always have ulterior (and sometimes mysterious) motives; in this case, he was trying to save gas by taking me to the Gate closer to my hotel and, according to Lonely Planet, possibly collect a kickback from camel and rickshaw drivers sitting near the West Gate waiting to take tourists to the Tajas ticket office. I donat bother to argue with him since thereas not much time until sunrise, and I walk quickly to the entrance. Standing in line with about twenty other mostly Indian tourists, Iam surprised to see a lack of Westerners a I imagined that every white person in India would be flocking to the Taj Mahal.
 
 
 
 Finally, the doors open, and I catch my first glimpse of the building considered to be the most beautiful in the world, one whose creator boasted that it made athe sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes.a I see the famous white, marble dome peeking through the arch of the Great Gate as tourists hold cameras high above their heads to get their first snapshot. I walk deliberately toward and around the Taj, soaking in the dawn, slowly taking photos from every possible angle. A handful of photographers gather in front of the adjacent Taj Mahal mosque with me to capture the sun as it rises behind it. Everyone is reverent, taking care not to interfere with othersa photographs and offering to help take posed pictures. The moment is perfect for the photographer gaggle: mist blankets the Yamuna River behind the structure, and the building looks like it has risen spontaneously from a clouded heaven, a concrete manifestation of nirvana.
 
 
 
 The simple presence of the Taj, built as a symbol of eternal love by Emperor Jahan in memory of his third wife who died during childbirth, seems to encourage even rabid photographers to cooperate with each other.
 
 
 
 I spend almost two hours touring and photographing the Taj, walking around its walls, admiring the calligraphy on the entrance arch, gazing at the minarets, and touching the intricate lattice screens in the mausoleum interior. Iam just about finished, taking a few final classic Taj Mahal reflection pool photographs from outside, when a beautiful, young blond woman performing playful, provocative poses for her friendas camera catches my eye. Soon, a string of Indian men, and some Indian families too, start interrupting to ask her to pose with them in souvenir photos.
 
 
 
 aThe Indian tourists seem more interested in your white skin and blond hair than the white marble of the Taj Mahal,a I say to her. aIam pretty sure a lot of these Indian guys are leaving with more pictures of you than the Taj.a
 
 
 
 She chuckles and introduces herself to me as Sophie, from France, and, quickly, weare trading funny stories of our travels through India. We like each other immediately. We find ourselves chatting in front of the Tajas reflection pool for about a half hour as Indian men gawk at us. But when Sophie and I realize that weare headed in opposite directions a she toward Amritsar in northern India and me toward Kerala in southern India a we share an awkward moment during which we realize that this is the one and only meeting of our entire lives.
 
 
 
 aWell, it truly has been a pleasure, Hank,a she says. Her eyes hold on mine. For a long moment, she doesnat look away. I canat tell whether sheas staring at me or at the exquisite reflection of the Taj Mahal in the pool behind me.
 
 
 
 She walks past me, in front of the rising sun. Then, she glances back at me one last time, smiles, and then shifts her gaze, once again, toward the worldas most beautiful symbol of eternal love.","This is the second essay in a two-part series about my journey to visit the Taj Mahal.

"Morning walk is a good exercise. An early-riser can be a regular morning walker. The benefits of morning walk are manifold.
 
 
 
 In the early morning everything looks fresh and fair. The atmosphere remains pleasant and calm. A morning walker breathes pollution-free air. He enjoys lovely sights and sounds of nature. All this soothes his soul.
 
 
 
 Regular morning walk keeps one fit. It helps form a sound health. Science says that morning walk controls blood pressure, lessens stress and strain and energizes one to work zealously.
 
 
 
 Now-a-days we are to live a very fast life. We are to work round the clock. We hardly have time to care for our health. If the habit of morning walk is formed right from our early days, we can be sure of a sound body and a sound mind.

We both decided to not disturb the old man and go somewhere else. We got back in the car and I still didnat feel okay.

"Nostalgia has me by the throat today. Iam not sure why. In an effort to assuage it, I am sifting through old photos and there are some great ones from a holiday a few years ago. I had gone on a family holiday with my parents and two siblings to Munnar in the tea country of Kerala. We drove from Kottayam to Munnar and stayed for a weekend. That trip too was steeped in nostalgia as my father had grown up there.
 
 
 
 When the three of us were little kids, our favorite bedtime stories were the aMunnar Talesa narrated with infectious enthusiasm by my father. We were never satisfied with one and would try to wheedle more by pleading hard. His yarns portrayed what seemed to be an idyllic country life to the three of us who lived in a flat in Bombay in those days. There were tales of runaway cows, gardening attempts, going to school in the cold winter and throwing up on long bus journeys down from the hills. Munnar always seemed like a little piece of heaven to me. Around the time my father went away to college, my grandfather relocated to our hometown of Kottayam following his retirement. My father didnat return for more than thirty years in fear of tainting his cherished memories. He finally gave in when the rest of his siblings planned a trip to see if their old house, school and other favorite places were still there.
 
 Munnar still seems a lovely town to me if you stay away from the crowded and badly constructed main areas. But my father insists that it was much better sixty years ago when the British company Messrs Finlay Muir & Co ran the town. The town had grown due to the tea estates owned by Finlay Muir in the name of Kanan Devan Hills Produce Company. From electricity generation to hospitals, everything was set up and managed by the company but he remembers it to be an extemely well-run town. Even the roads were washed down everyday, he says. The company also ran the school where my granddad was the Headmaster and that my father attended. He recalls the Munnar Supply Association (MSA) being a shop for the British with many imported things that seemed exotic to him like cheese and preserves. We went in to take a look on that trip but there was nothing remotely exotic in there.
 
 Last year my parents came along on a location visit to Munnar to add properties for seek&hide. We stayed at one of our favourite homestays in Munnar, Casa del Fauno and were lucky that we caught both the glorious sunset and sunrise over a steep valley. My father looked so content and happy to be back in Munnar. The next day we visited another of our hotels in Munnar, Windermere Estate. The manager mentioned that the great grandson of James Finlay had stayed with them a while ago. So we were not the only people who were making nostalgic trips to Munnar :) If you look at these pictures, it will be clear why I am a wee bit sentimental about the place too.","Nostalgia has me by the throat today.

"I would have to say , I was a pretty well rounded at sports as a child, but only solitary sports. I was one of the last picked for a team for most of my childhood. Amazingly , I was okay with that. I loved to ride my bike and rode it to and from work in junior high. I would ride with my friends all summer long around town. This was our freedom, these were our wheels to get to where we wanted to go. I swam every summer at the local pool, even the swim team. But never at high school level with the girls at school. I guess you couls say, fear held me back somewhat. I powerwalked into my 20as, joined a gym for awhile. Started yoga in my 30as and them started having babies. Gained too much weight, 11 years later still carring it around. For awhile I been talking to myself , saying you needs this , your body need to move.But, with 4 kids I have let everyone elseas needs come before my own. I also started with a whole new kind of fear, that something could happen to me and where would my children be. Crazy how we sometimes let our negative self cheat us out of life sometimes. But I can say with much joy now it is my children , now that they are older are bringing the old comfotable me back. We got kayaks this summer and have had a absolute awesome time with them. They are the best, what a feeling of peace floating along and paddling on Flathead Lake , Montana. I stared yoga again and Iam walking more. Although I started walking because of my overweight Lab Slick. In the end we both needed that exercise.Iam finding my peace again, that peace that each of us get from being active and in our breath. Life is so short to live with self doubt and fear, so Iam going to try and wear it out! To be a champion for my kids and keep them active and be active for them!!!!

And while returning from shop somehow I dropped my wallet somewhere on the road. After returning to home I searched like hell all my rooms and didnat find my wallet, ran back to shop, searched roads, my apartmentas staircase but still didnat find. Human nature : Started praying to Allah, kept murmuring aPlease Allah, Please Allaha. Let me tell you I was least bothered about money that I had inside it, I was worried for all the Govt. issued card, credit and debit cards)a|. Yeah Yeah.. go on and call me stupid, even I realized this last night. The place where I stay is Fremont which is bit interior and lot of constructions are going on. This made me think that if any worker will find how he will call me. So thinking this after 1 hour, I quit searching and consoled myself that itas gone, move on. I was sad about the Govt card and trust me, I became more sad. It was pathetic. Just after few minutes, I got an unknown call. Somewhere deep down my heart, I knew this was the call I was waiting for. I was happy, the man at other end asked me to come near his house which was around 100 meters from my place. After disconnecting the call, I rana|. (Run, Forrest, Run ! was on my mind). And finally I got my wallet back with all my cards and money inside. My eyes were wet and I thanked that uncle so much. But to my surprise, he replied, aIt wasn't me, who found ita and pointed his finger towards an African American man standing besides him. He was worker and seeing him I simply jumped on him to hug him and he was very shy. I said ton of Thanks to him but I felt Thanks was very very small word at that time, the amount of money and hard work he saved for me. I was so happy I gave him 100 Dollar from my wallet and further said Please let me know if you need any kind of help, but he was very shy he refuesd to take money May Allah Bless him","Today is Wed and I stepped in office with a big smile on my face.

"Truer words were never spoken, and Lincoln nailed it on this quote on happiness. Itas just a matter of making up your mind to be happy, and then from there never look back. Life is like a buffet and there are all sorts of things you can focus on. Some will make you feel good and others will make you feel bad, but the choice is yours as to which ones you want to give your attention to, and where you set your mood.

Realizing that you hold the key to your own happiness, and that's itas just a decision away can be a real breakthrough."

"Summer vacation. It was a long journey to Ooty from Delhi, but we thoroughly enjoyed it. We reached Mettupalayam by train. From there we took another train for Wellington. This journey, in the little mountain railway, was quite exhilarating and unforgettable.
 
 
 
 
 
 During the journey we saw breath-taking scenes of Nigeria hills and forests. There were my maternal uncle, aunt, their little daughter Jasmine and 2 attendants to receive us at the station. We were overAjoyed to see and meet one another.
 
 
 
 The following day, and then on the week-end, we visited Ooty. On both these visits we enjoyed the beauty, freshness, food walking, horse-riding and excursions. Situated at the height of 2,286 meters on Nigeria hills, Ooty is a very popular and famous hill resort of South India. It is in the state of Tamil Nadu. Full of rich tourist- activities and possibilities round the year, Ooty was discovered in 1819 by the then collector of Combater, an Englishman, Mr. John Sullivan. He constructed his summer residence there. He was the first man to do so. He was soon followed by numerous other Englishmen. It then became the summer seat of Provincial Government of Madras.
 
 The temperate coolness attracts a large crowd of people from nearby areas, provinces and distant parts of the country. Originally it belonged to the Toads, a hill tribe which still lives in the Nigeria Hills. This aQueen of the Hill Stationsa is full of nice outdoor activities like hiking, boating, fishing, horse-riding, long walks, excursions and shopping. There is a big and wonderful botanical garden in the very heart of the town. It has more than 600 varieties of exotic plants and trees. We visited the botanical garden and then enjoyed boating in the lake.
 
 
 
 We went to Deadbeats Peak in our uncleas car. From there we had an excellent panoramic view of the plains below. Is the highest point and boasts the height of 2,638 meters. There is also a telescope for the viewing pleasure of the tourists. We also visited and immensely enjoyed the nearby Samas Park, a nice picnic spot full of many varieties of plants, trees, herbs and a fine pool full of lilies.
 
 
 
 The shopping in the small but colorful market of the town is an unforgettable experience. Mother bought a few silk sarisa, spices and some other items as gifts for our friends and relations. I bought some special tea and items of woodcraft. Ooty, overlooking blue hills and lush green valleys, is a very pleasant place and tourist resort. There was a big crowd of Indian and foreign tourists.
 
 
 
 We also visited nearby Connor, a small but colorful town amidst sprawling tea gardens. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this still station. We also exposed a number of films to capture beautiful and natural scenes, events and memorable moments. These photographs will help us to keep our joy and memories of the place ever new and fresh.","Summer vacation. It was a long journey to Ooty from Delhi, but we thoroughly enjoyed it.

"I had the most unforgettable experience in my life . It is an experience about helping a blind man to cross the street. I still remember that day vividly. That night I had studied at school library; it was around 10 oaclock, and I prepared to go back home. As I passed through the school gate, I said goodbye to my friends. Suddenly I saw a strange thing in front of me. There was a male standing beside the cross-walk; the traffic light was green, he could walk forward, but he didnat. He was just standing there and made no actions. I was confused at this sight. Out of curiosity, I decided to walk over to him and to see what was happening. I felt perplexed until I walked next to him. Standing beside him, I could see he was wearing sunglasses and holding a white stick; then I knew this man was blind. In this cold winter day, pedestrians all wore heavy coats, including him and me. His was gray and mine was black. I also noticed that there was a sign around his neck. The sign said aI am virtually deaf and blind; please help me cross the street. Tap me on the shoulder.a I knew I must help him. So I tapped him on the shoulder, and then he put his left hand on my right shoulder and I led him across the street. All the process was quiet; the only thing I could hear was the sounds of our steps. It was a chilly night too, but I knew he would feel warm at this moment. When we got across the street, he bowed in thanks, and started walking up the block, to the next corner, then the next. While he walked past me, I couldnat help but start to weep. I wanted to walk him home. It was not a very busy street, almost deserted. He could have been there, on that corner, for 10 minutes. Maybe he is still at another corner, now, waiting. How does he get home? How does he know where his home is? Thinking of this, I cried more loudly. I canat image being deaf and blind. You would be so helpless and dependent on other people. Can you imagine going home like that every day: walking a block, then waiting for someone to help you get across the street, then walking another block, and waiting, relying on the kindness of strangers? After this incident, I realized how blessed I am. I should cherish every day and do my best to help the people who need help in my life.","I had the most unforgettable experience in my life .

"There are two types of people in the world: those who choose to be happy, and those who choose to be unhappy. Contrary to popular belief, happiness doesnat come from fame, fortune, other people, or material possessions. Rather, it comes from within. The richest person in the world could be miserable while a person living in the slums of a third world country could be happy and content. I have spent plenty of time amongst both groups to have seen it first hand. Happy people are happy because they make themselves happy. They maintain a positive outlook on life and remain at peace with themselves.","There are two types of people in the world: those who choose to be happy, and those who choose to be unhappy.

"I took a cab and it was morning 8:30am, I was on the way to office.
 
 
 
 After reaching my office, I needed to pay him seventy rupees, I had given him a hundred rupees note, he should give me back thirty rupees but instead he gave seventy rupees to me( a fifty and one twenty rupees notes). I was in hurry and I just took the change from him and while putting it into my purse, I noticed the fifty rupees and it striked on my mind, I given him back seventy rupees and took thirty rupees from him.
 
 
 
 After giving him back his money, he was really very happy that I haven't took the advantage of his mistake. Now, why I'm happy, I'm happy because, I knew that I'm honest but sometime when you realise your honest self, it's a pleasure for you, it's a happiness for your soul and this happiness everyone should have in their life atleast once, in whatever way it comes.","I took a cab and it was morning 8:30am, I was on the way to office.

"I like traveling. Iam very thankful to god because giving me a family that loves to travel. When I go for traveling with my family, there are a lot of interesting place that we visit. Between traveling at bigger city and go traveling at Island, I will choose the Island to travel. I donat like travel at bigger city because it was so noisy and a lot of pollution. Enough for me to live and always trapped in the traffic jam especially when Iam go back home to my own town Johor Bharu. My parent will take us to go for traveling especially when school holiday is coming. A wonderful holiday that I still remember until now is when my family and I went to Tioman Island when school holiday. That was the first time and first experience I went to Tioman Island. We stayed at Tioman Resort about three days. About seven oaclock early in the morning, we took a car to go to Jeti Mersing from Kota Tinggi. Around nine in the morning, we arrived at Jeti Mersing and my father parked his car at there. We take a bot at ten oaclock. Our journey from Jetty Mersing to Tioman Island is about one hour and thirty minute. Along travel to Tioman Island by bot, I saw many interesting scenery like a lot of monkey when our bot is near to the near Island and the water was very clean and clear blue in colour. Iam the one who was very excited to arrived at Tioman Island. At twelve noon, we safely arrived at Tioman Island. I was very excited. The scenery was very amazing with the birds flying anywhere just like to welcome us. It is so fascinating to be there. When we went out from the bot, have a car exactly like when we see when people playing a golf was waiting for us to take us to the resort. Along in the car, we found a lot of monkey was climbed the trees. The driver also looked very friendly and love to tell us about Tiomal Island.","I like traveling.

A wonderful holiday that I still remember until now is when my family and I went to Tioman Island when school holiday. That was the first time and first experience I went to Tioman Island. We stayed at Tioman Resort about three days. About seven o'clock early in the morning, we took a car to go to Jeti Mersing from Kota Tinggi. Around nine in the morning, we arrived at Jeti Mersing and my father parked his car at there. We take a bot at ten o'clock. Our journey from Jetty Mersing to Tioman Island is about one hour and thirty minute. Along travel to Tioman Island by bot, I saw many interesting scenery like a lot of monkey when our bot is near to the near Island and the water was very clean and clear blue in colour. Iam the one who was very excited to arrived at Tioman Island. At twelve noon, we safely arrived at Tioman Island. I was very excited. The scenery was very amazing with the birds flying anywhere just like to welcome us. It is so fascinating to be there. When we went out from the bot, have a car exactly like when we see when people playing a golf was waiting for us to take us to the resort. Along in the car, we found a lot of monkey was climbed the trees. The driver also looked very friendly and love to tell us about Tiomal Island."

"This one is pretty minuscule, we had to go to the laundromat today and obviously I had all three of my kids with me, my 5 year old, my 2 year old and my 5 month old. Last time we had to go they were all butts, my 5 month old wanted to scream the whole time and my two girls were all over the place. Today they were basically perfect, my 5 month old stayed content in his carseat with his toys and I tried to make it more fun for my girls so after getting the clothes in the dryer we went and got drinks and they just sat patiently waiting with minimal outbursts. It was nice to get laundry done in some peace and I really appreciated the fact that some part of them realized that this needed to get done.","This one is pretty minuscule, we had to go to the laundromat today and obviously I had all three of my kids with me, my 5 year old, my 2 year old and my 5 month old.

"There are two types of people in the world: those who choose to be happy, and those who choose to be unhappy. Contrary to popular belief, happiness doesnat come from fame, fortune, other people, or material possessions. Rather, it comes from within. The richest person in the world could be miserable while a person living in the slums of a third world country could be happy and content. I have spent plenty of time amongst both groups to have seen it first hand. Happy people are happy because they make themselves happy.","There are two types of people in the world: those who choose to be happy, and those who choose to be unhappy.

 The Basilica of Bom Jesus is the most august and famous of all the churches in Old Goa. It contains the relics of St.Framcis Xavier, Patron saint of Goa, Apostle of the Indies. The construction of the church began on the 24th November 1594 AD. It is built of black laterite stone. The relics of St Francis Xavier were kept in this chapel from 1623-55 AD. The Blessed Sacrament was earlier kept on the main altar under the statue of St Ignatius and now is preserved in a gold tabernacle. The body of St. Francis Xavier was brought here from the College of St Paul after his canonization in 1624 AD. It was shifted to its present location in 1655 AD. The crystal urn was made in the Casa Brandizzi at Rome and was brought to Goa on January 30th 1955. The old wooden coffin with its three keys is now kept in the museum at the Professed House of the Jesuits

 first time when I was 10 years old. Since that time I saw shows like that several times, but the
 
 feelings of the very first time are still in my haert and they are unforgettable.
 
 The show had to start during sunset, and since it was arranged on the bank of the rive on a hot
 
 summer day everything around bacame pink. Trees, river, air, people around -everything was
 
 paintad with a tender pink colour. That day was extremely hot but in the evening the air turned to
 
 be fresh and clean. The blowing breeze was very pleasent. The show was delayed. At first we
 
 were nervous about that, but now I understand that it was planned ahead and we were really
 
 lucky to see the sunset. Very soon it became darker and at last the show started.
 
 The show was accompanied by modern music and the fountains really danced and people
 
 danced too. Everybody was so excited!","Very often people donat remember their day-by-day routine, but if something unusual or extra

"Having the feeling of losing a loved one is something that everyone eventually experiences. Losing my grandpa in a car accident is by far the most devastating thing I had to learn to cope with. My grandpa and I were really close. We did many things together until the day somebody decided to have a drink while driving behind the wheel. Not only did the drunk driver pay dearly for his senseless act. He also took my grandfatheras life when he collided into the side of his car.
 
  Though my grandfatheras death was five years ago, I still remember him. An image of him is still locked in my mind, but my memories of him are faint. After breakfast on Saturdays, we would play in the park and feed the ducks. I would hold my grandpaas hand and I remember how his hands felt very much like paper, yet very callused from long years of hard work. When it rained out, he baked me fudge brownies and cookies. My grandpa was always there when I needed a wound to be tended to or when I was sick and not feeling well. I miss my grandpa dearly with all my heart, and I wish I could tell him now how much I miss everything we used to do together.","Having the feeling of losing a loved one is something that everyone eventually experiences.

I would hold my grandpaas hand and I remember how his hands felt very much like paper, yet very callused from long years of hard work. When it rained out, he baked me fudge brownies and cookies. My grandpa was always there when I needed a wound to be tended to or when I was sick and not feeling well. I miss my grandpa dearly with all my heart, and I wish I could tell him now how much I miss everything we used to do together."

With a job, I can receive payment, which supports my personal expenses such as paying for a meal, purchasing a fashion dress, renew my apartment and so forth. All these are the security to ensure my independent life and the source of freedom and happiness. Without a job, it is impossible for me to live a happy life. In this case, indeed, my job enjoys a vital impact on my happiness.
 
 
 
 Furthermore, social life, also a necessary part of modern life, has a profound effect on everyone. As far as Iam concerned, social life contains that keeping an inmate relationship with friends, family and co-workers. It would be hard to imagine if one have a terrible social life or even have no social life, how out-dated he or she will be and how tedious his or her life will be. Every year, I will spend my holidays traveling with my friends and family during which we can take beautiful photos and share private life stories with each other. These unforgettable memories are my lifelong measures and bring me endless happiness.
 
 
 
 To sum up, my job and my social life serve as different benefits. And they are equally important and both beneficial to my happiness. My job meets the needs and expenses of my daily life, providing sufficient physical fundaments which are the security of a happy life. In addition, my social life allows me to keep a harmony relationship with friends and family and brings a source of happiness. In turn, both my job.","Happiness, a main goal of modern life, undeniable becomes the biggest concern of the world.

"Nowadays, people live in a busier world stuffed with endless routines from the work than that in the past. Besides the decent job that one might have, enjoying the wonderful and trustful social life are something worth pursuing as well. However, it seems that everyone in the workplace just wants to get his/her jobs done, and it is apparently that one always shares less interaction with people than that in the social life. Thereby, I disagree with the description above. To reinforce my statement, here are the reasons behind it.
 
 
 
 First of all, for instance of mine, a regular job doesnat occupy much of my personal time. There are over half of the day allowing me to live in the world out of the daily annoyed work. Therefore, I feel enjoyable to manage my social life. I get used to writing my personal blog, answering the questions that someone else leaves. I interact with huge variety of people, discussing with the latest trends in technology or society. Moreover, I meet different friends with wide diversity of characteristics in some atmospheric cafes nearby where I live. Those kinds of feelings of connecting with people truthfully rather than in the relationship of employees and employers always help me open my mind spontaneously to others. 
 
 
 
 Secondly, managing such a great social life grants me sense of achievement and happiness. Some may liken how successful the one could be in work to how much happiness can enjoy in life, but I am not on that side. A wonderful social life consists of tons of friends is something that can last longer, because there is always some day that we will leave our job. Without devoting much of our time then, we may acquire sense of loneliness if we donat have a robust or trustworthy relationships with others. Friends made in the job is highly prone to lose connections when you and friends of yours no longer work together or share the same goal. Besides, the friendships built off work have those sort of conflicts less.","Nowadays, people live in a busier world stuffed with endless routines from the work than that in the past.

@ReginalTSquirge you could add a jaunty bow\nOr bells,"This is the second essay in a two-part series about my journey to visit the Taj Mahal. Read the first part for the whole story.
 
 
 
 A
 
 GRA, Uttar Pradesh, India -- As soon as my train to Agra leaves from Delhi, I find myself confused again. I'm lying on my reserved upper berth, though most of the train car beds aren't being used and almost all of the passengers are sitting on lower seats. I feel ridiculous, like I'm emperor of my train car, overseeing the rest of the passengers from above. Meanwhile, men pass by below me, offering a mysterious vegetarian curry out of industrial-sized buckets. I motion for one to serve me some on a paper plate, but when I try to pay for the food, he won't accept any money. This is the first time I've gotten anything for free in India. I conclude that the food is going to kill me.
 
 
 
 While I'm eating, the train makes a stop and passengers disembark, but the conductor makes no announcements. I can't see through any of the train's tiny lower windows from my upper bunk. I have no idea where I am.
 
 
 
 ""Is this Agra?"" I ask a man sitting below me. I ask as nicely as possible, in an attempt to avoid appearing as a self-righteous train car emperor, shouting questions to my serfs. After all, I remember, Taj Mahal-builder and Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son soon after the Taj Mahal's completion. The man below shakes his head and, in Hindi, I think he tells me that we still have a long ride to Agra. Another man walks by selling non-vegetarian food in foil tins. The first shots of an intestinal war have already been fired as a result of my free bucket food, so I decline. As the train chugs toward Agra, stopping at stations along the way, I find myself continuously recruiting new serfs below me to keep track of where we are. By the time I'm halfway through the journey, I have an eighteen year old kid, two Indian soldiers, and a young woman -- none of whom can speak English -- trying to assist me. It's easy to accidentally aggregate helpers on the train; mercifully, Indians tend to be especially protective of clueless Westerners trying to make sense of Indian public transportation. At one point, the two Indian soldiers demand that a teenager move his feet resting on my berth, and the young woman makes food recommendations as buckets whisk by. They're kind of like four Train-Fairy Godmothers. Soon, I fall asleep.
 
 
 
 Suddenly, I awake to the sound of four Indians chanting ""Agra! Agra!"" in unison. I abruptly end my time as train car emperor, jump down from my bed, thank the four of them, and catch a taxi to my Agra guesthouse. Before he leaves, I arrange for my taxi driver to pick me up at 6 AM the next morning to take me to the Taj Mahal.
 
 
 
 In the morning, I tell my driver to take me to the East Gate of the Taj Mahal. He promptly takes me to a roundabout near the West Gate instead -- though his ""East Gate!"" announcement upon our arrival is quite convincing. India's perpetually dishonest taxi drivers always have ulterior (and sometimes mysterious) motives; in this case, he was trying to save gas by taking me to the Gate closer to my hotel and, according to Lonely Planet, possibly collect a kickback from camel and rickshaw drivers sitting near the West Gate waiting to take tourists to the Taj's ticket office. I don't bother to argue with him since there's not much time until sunrise, and I walk quickly to the entrance. Standing in line with about twenty other mostly Indian tourists, I'm surprised to see a lack of Westerners -- I imagined that every white person in India would be flocking to the Taj Mahal.
 
 
 
 Finally, the doors open, and I catch my first glimpse of the building considered to be the most beautiful in the world, one whose creator boasted that it made ""the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes."" I see the famous white, marble dome peeking through the arch of the Great Gate as tourists hold cameras high above their heads to get their first snapshot. I walk deliberately toward and around the Taj, soaking in the dawn, slowly taking photos from every possible angle. A handful of photographers gather in front of the adjacent Taj Mahal mosque with me to capture the sun as it rises behind it. Everyone is reverent, taking care not to interfere with others' photographs and offering to help take posed pictures. The moment is perfect for the photographer gaggle: mist blankets the Yamuna River behind the structure, and the building looks like it has risen spontaneously from a clouded heaven, a concrete manifestation of nirvana.
 
 
 
 The simple presence of the Taj, built as a symbol of eternal love by Emperor Jahan in memory of his third wife who died during childbirth, seems to encourage even rabid photographers to cooperate with each other.
 
 
 
 I spend almost two hours touring and photographing the Taj, walking around its walls, admiring the calligraphy on the entrance arch, gazing at the minarets, and touching the intricate lattice screens in the mausoleum interior. I'm just about finished, taking a few final classic Taj Mahal reflection pool photographs from outside, when a beautiful, young blond woman performing playful, provocative poses for her friend's camera catches my eye. Soon, a string of Indian men, and some Indian families too, start interrupting to ask her to pose with them in souvenir photos.
 
 
 
 ""The Indian tourists seem more interested in your white skin and blond hair than the white marble of the Taj Mahal,"" I say to her. ""I'm pretty sure a lot of these Indian guys are leaving with more pictures of you than the Taj.""
 
 
 
 She chuckles and introduces herself to me as Sophie, from France, and, quickly, we're trading funny stories of our travels through India. We like each other immediately. We find ourselves chatting in front of the Taj's reflection pool for about a half hour as Indian men gawk at us. But when Sophie and I realize that we're headed in opposite directions -- she toward Amritsar in northern India and me toward Kerala in southern India -- we share an awkward moment during which we realize that this is the one and only meeting of our entire lives.
 
 
 
 ""Well, it truly has been a pleasure, Hank,"" she says. Her eyes hold on mine. For a long moment, she doesn't look away. I can't tell whether she's staring at me or at the exquisite reflection of the Taj Mahal in the pool behind me.
 
 
 
 She walks past me, in front of the rising sun. Then, she glances back at me one last time, smiles, and then shifts her gaze, once again, toward the world's most beautiful symbol of eternal love."

Okay~ #deepbreathes ������ we can do this @sydneyswans ������������������ #cheer #cheer &amp; see you on the other side peeps ������ #AFLCatsSwans #ProudlySydney,"Many people take this week off from work and school to spend time with their families. The holidays are a good time to strengthen our connections and renew relationships. So turn off the cell phones, computers and televisions and take time to focus on your family.
 
  Research shows that families who spend time together are strong families. They communicate better and share a sense of belonging. Here are a few ideas you can try to spend time with your family.
 
  * Family game night. Spend at least one night during the holidays with the TV off and the family huddled together to play a favorite game. You may play cards, bingo or any other family favorite. Consider continuing this practice throughout the year and designate at least one night per week as family game night.
 
  * Go for a walk. After eating rich holiday foods, taking a walk provides not only time together but a great way to get some exercise.
 
  * Movie night. Rent a movie or watch a TV holiday special, pop some popcorn, and kick back for some family fun. Like game night, this may be something you'd like to continue throughout the year as a way to spend time together.
 
  * Play outdoors together. You can ride bikes, play ball, or go for a hike. Itall give the entire family some fresh air, exercise and great fun.
 
  * Go shopping. Hang out together while shopping at the after Christmas sales.
 
  * Cook together. Parents and kids can do the holiday baking and food preparation together. Even the youngest children can wash vegetables, set the table, or ice cookies.
 
  * Spend some one-on-one time with each child if you have more than one. Spending time alone provides time to bond with the child and helps him gain a sense of belonging and feeling of importance. It also provides an opportunity for the two of you to get to know each other better.
 
  * Since grandparents and older family members usually visit during the holidays, take time to share family customs and tell stories about past generations. Families build strength when they share family customs and traditions give family members a sense of belonging, and they strengthen values and beliefs. 
 
  One of the greatest gifts of the holiday season is the gift of time with family. Spend time together to strengthen relationships and to make wonderful family memories. Strong families spend time with each other - quality time in large quantities. So begin during the holidays and continue making time for each other throughout the year."

I have been in love with a girl for the past 10 years. She is a girl who have not been exposed to the public a much as she has been sticking to her studies and home so far. Recently she started working and i found she started to minkle more with people around and chatting with new friends especially boys. That hurted me badly. Now you must be thinking how does this makes me happy. I have been hearing from childhood that we only love or go close to god when we realize that anything or anyone in this world cannot give us true unconditional love and happiness thus leading us to detachment. The moment i realized that every relation which is worldly is with expectations and the love i felt from him during that lonelyness made me extremely happy.,I have been in love with a girl for the past 10 years.

 So, the graduation ceremony was in the main auditorium of the university and everyone was there, all the students, faculty members and of course family and other invited guests. There were the usual speeches, presentation of degrees to graduates and a few other things which the faculty had organized, and then after we organized a big lunch.
 
 
 
 There was my own family and three of my friends and their families as well, so it was quite an occasion. We had this family lunch at a local restaurant which we had booked for the afternoon. It was a really special time having all the most important people in my life together at the same time.
 
 
 
 Later on, when the family members had left we went out to a bar and had a few beers together just me and my friends. Looking back on it now, it was one of the happiest days of my life I think a we all felt like we had really achieved something graduating and that particular day was really good for all of us.

Her competent, efficient, productive, coveted, fore & far sighted leadership assets are well known around the company. She is quite happy about these new responsibilities & I am at once profoundly proud of her for this achievement as well as for the wonderful, unparalleled gifted lives that she has made possible for us as a family. She is a deeply loving, deeply caring, selfless, brilliant, a force of nature and very beautiful wonder woman. I am at a loss for thought, feelings & words as to where on earth I would be without her magical angelic existence in our lives. She rocks my world. Hence, I uncorked the champagnes & celebrate this terrific pick with her. This was ever so, for me, one of the happiest, most awesome moments. What can I say beyond that, you ask? Plenty. But, I will do you a favor and halt right here. No further comments."
"I was worried one of my pets (I have lots of pets) had stomach cancer, after what one of my vets said during her last visit. He said that she may need a biopsy of her stomach. However, he soon learned that she does not have stomach cancer with no surgery necessary. She has feline IBD (irritable bowel), which is helped by dietary change and probitiocs and steroids.","I was worried one of my pets (I have lots of pets) had stomach cancer, after what one of my vets said during her last visit.

"Okay, so a couple of months ago I graduated from university - it was a really happy time for me, and although my family and I had already celebrated finishing my degree successfully, the official graduation day ceremony was really quite special, and a very happy day, for me and my friends. It was one of the last times that all of us were together because shortly after that two of our group left to go abroad and theyall be there for about two years before they come back home.
 
 
 
 So, the graduation ceremony was in the main auditorium of the university and everyone was there, all the students, faculty members and of course family and other invited guests. There were the usual speeches, presentation of degrees to graduates and a few other things which the faculty had organized, and then after we organized a big lunch.
 
 
 
 There was my own family and three of my friends and their families as well, so it was quite an occasion. We had this family lunch at a local restaurant which we had booked for the afternoon. It was a really special time having all the most important people in my life together at the same time.
 
 
 
 Later on, when the family members had left we went out to a bar and had a few beers together just me and my friends. Looking back on it now, it was one of the happiest days of my life I think a we all felt like we had really achieved something graduating and that particular day was really good for all of us. I hope that maybe in a couple of years we can arrange a sort of reunion a so that we can all get together again and catch up with each other.","Okay, so a couple of months ago I graduated from university - it was a really happy time for me, and although my family and I had already celebrated finishing my degree successfully, the official graduation day ceremony was really quite special, and a very happy day, for me and my friends.

 The first time I experienced what experts call aReverse Culture Shocka was after returning home from a Year Abroad Program in Galway, Ireland. My home town, which before had given me a sense of comfort and belonging, upon returning seemed stifling and bereft of warmth.

I eventually came face to face with the starling reality that my home would never, ever again feel the same as it had before. I had sealed my fate the moment I had boarded that plane the year before.
 
 
 
 I donat think there is really any way to describe this feeling to those who havenat experienced it themselves. Itas a little like free-falling.

"The Kashmiri doesnat care whose flag he follows, whose anthem he sounds. As long as the Kashmiri gets to row his shikara, herd his sheep, temper his willow bats, grow his apples and light his kangri in peace, whatas an India, what is a Pakistan.
 
 
 
 It has been an illuminating first day in Kashmir. The flight from Delhi spelt its own episodes, but thatas another, rather insignificant, story. A delay caused due to fog meant that we touched down at Srinagar Airport an hour behind schedule.
 
 
 
 But enough of that; let the story begin.
 
 The passage from the boarding gate to the baggage check reminds me of a Republic Day paradeawithout the celebration. Rows of stoic-looking men in full combat gear holding INSAS rifles greet me as I proceed towards the baggage counter. On the arrivals desk across the hall, a mini-police station of sorts deals with nervous-looking foreigners and Kashmiris on their way out. The customary chatter and hubbub youad find in any airport is much subdued here.
 
 The driveras name is Shakeel Ahmed. A man of average height, with an oval-shaped head, a self-conscious smile and the customary reserve youad find in town folk whenever they encounter city dwellers like myself.
 
 
 
 That reserve dissolves quickly as I start asking him about the Kashmiri way of life.
 
 
 
 aWell sir, the people here, they like to work,a he says, smoothly overtaking a truck carrying logs. aWhether itas growing saffron, or almonds, weaving cloth, or going to school, we like to stay occupied. Thatas why I donat like winter so much. Too little time to get out and about.a
 
 
 
 As we cross Lal Chowk, I am struck by the inconspicuousness of roadside beggars anywhere.
 
 
 
 aOh, you wonat find any beggars in Kashmir, sir,a Shakeel says, aKashmiris are a proud people. We donat like opening our palms, except in prayer.a
 
 
 
 The Kashmiri livelihood, I learn, comes from growing things and showing things. The village folk depend on saffron, almonds, apples, wood and weaving for their livelihood. City dwellers are invested in various services for the visiting tourist.
 
 
 
 aThereas plenty of money in Kashmir,a Shakeel remarks, abut you wonat see it out in the open. We are not ostentatious by nature.a
 
 
 
 An offhand barb at Delhi brashness, I suspect, but let it pass.
 
 We pass through a crowded marketplace. Glittering streamers and flags of Pakistan hang from the ropeways overhead. I ask him about the flags.
 
 
 
 aOh, they arenat Pakistani flags, sir,a he replies with a short laugh. aThese are for Bada Din. Look, that banner over there says aId Milaapa.a
 
 
 
 Donat I feel foolish.
 
 
 
 aActually, this district, Pulwama, it has 95 per cent Muslims. Bada Din is celebrated with a lot of pomp and circumstance. That road forking right leads to Pulwama town. Itas renowned for its shopian apples and, well, other things,a Shakeel says with a quiet smile.
 
 
 
 The other things, it turns out, are afeem (opium) and hashish (marijuana).
 
 
 
 aSaara do number ka kaam wahaan par hota hai, sir,a remarks Shakeel with a wink.
 
 
 
 I return the wink as a road milestone closes. aPahalgam: 98 kilometres,a the sign reads.
 
 Weave pulled over beside a large shop with a sign that reads aKesar Valley'. Shakeel seems to have taken a personal affront to the fact that Iave never had kahwah in my life, and decides the experience can wait no longer.
 
 Two bearded men nurse the counter, sitting cross-legged on low stools. The long table in front of them displays almonds, kernels, tiny containers of saffron, cans of almond oil, homemade hand cream and a host of other items. One of them rises to greet me.
 
 
 
 aSalaam ailakum, welcome to Kesar Valley.a
 
 
 
 Tall, bearded, unsmiling, with intense, brooding eyes, Nisaar Ahmad could be the worst fear of any ignoramus who pays heed to manufactured media. Shakeel exchanges a quiet word with the other man, who then disappears behind a curtain.
 
 
 
 Nisaar comes straight to business. Directing my attention to a stack of photo frames, he begins, aOur roots lie in saffron farming. My grandfather grew saffron, his son grew saffron after him, and nowa|,a he gestures to himself.
 
 
 
 His companion returns with a bag of almonds.
 
 
 
 aTry them. No, in fact, crush them on the counter here,a Nisaar commands, aThere, see the way the oil oozes out? You wonat find almonds like these anywhere outside Kashmir.a","The Kashmiri doesnat care whose flag he follows, whose anthem he sounds.

 The other things, it turns out, are afeem (opium) and hashish (marijuana).
 
 
 
 aSaara do number ka kaam wahaan par hota hai, sir,a remarks Shakeel with a wink.
 
 
 
 I return the wink as a road milestone closes. aPahalgam: 98 kilometres,a the sign reads.
 
 Weave pulled over beside a large shop with a sign that reads aKesar Valley'. Shakeel seems to have taken a personal affront to the fact that Iave never had kahwah in my life, and decides the experience can wait no longer.
 
 Two bearded men nurse the counter, sitting cross-legged on low stools. The long table in front of them displays almonds, kernels, tiny containers of saffron, cans of almond oil, homemade hand cream and a host of other items. One of them rises to greet me.
 
 
 
 aSalaam ailakum, welcome to Kesar Valley.a
 
 
 
 Tall, bearded, unsmiling, with intense, brooding eyes, Nisaar Ahmad could be the worst fear of any ignoramus who pays heed to manufactured media. Shakeel exchanges a quiet word with the other man, who then disappears behind a curtain.
 
 
 
 Nisaar comes straight to business. Directing my attention to a stack of photo frames, he begins, aOur roots lie in saffron farming. My grandfather grew saffron, his son grew saffron after him, and nowa|,a he gestures to himself.
 
 
 
 His companion returns with a bag of almonds.
 
 
 
 aTry them. No, in fact, crush them on the counter here,a Nisaar commands, there, see the way the oil oozes out? You won't find almonds like these anywhere outside Kashmir.a"

"Can we plan for Tirupati Balaji Mandir on 17th ?a An unexpected noon phone call from Hubby.
 
 
 
 aI may, if you want to goa|."" I was quick to reply, but, added one ""But"" to it....
 
 
 
 ""But I wonat guarantee whether I would go inside the temple or nota|.if itas too much of crowd, I may give up half the way tooa|a I clarified.
 
 
 
 So, a quick plan was made with two other families, Hubbyas colleagues, Basav and Silky with their families. 
 
 
 
 Itas been long time, though I felt like visiting this - one of the richest temples in the world, it was not in my wish-list as I heard it is one of the most crowded temples too. On an average 50,000 to 100,000 devotees visit the Tirupati Balaji temple at Tirumala every day. Sandip, Nabami, Mittal, so many friends of mine shared their experience with me that itas just for 5 -10 seconds, one get a glimpse of the Idol of Lord Balaji. The pushing crowd and security personals would push you forward automatically. 
 
 
 
 On 16th, the day was too hectic for me. Work, dizziness and the tension of facing huge crowd at the temple made me so exhausted that sleeping queen refused to come to my eyes even for a minute, though I tried to bring her in at least for 4 hours.
 
 
 
 We started at 1:57 AM from Bangalore on 17th, while I vomited on the way twice, because of my uneasiness. I just recalled my pregnancy time that moment. We reached Tirupati town at 7:30 AM. We already had booked one hotel. This time, sleeping queen attacked me badly and took me to a deep sleep for at least one hour.
 
 
 
 Somehow, I managed to get up from Bed at 8:30 AM, quickly took bath and tried my level best to be positive in attitude. We were out from the hotel by 9 AM.
 
 
 
 In the first entrance of the Temple campus, we had a proper security check; every individual, the luggage, and the vehicle, all were scanned.
 
 Beautiful view, cleanliness of the town, stunning curvy roads made us fresh and positive. There was a special instruction on speed limit while driving up the Tirumala hill, 25 kilometer of ascent is to be completed not earlier than 28 minutes. In case, any vehicle reaches there early, it will be penalized for driving fast. 
 
 Basav shaved his hair, and during that time, rest of us just had some quick breakfast in one of the roadside stalls. I was just amazed to see the cleanliness all around. Some people were sitting in the middle of the road even, to eat food.
 
 We covered the whole queue area in 20 mins. No electronic items are allowed, such as camera, mobile phones, but they allow wallets. Everyone has to wear traditional dresses, for man, dhoti or kurta were mandatory and for woman, Saree, Salwar suit etc. There was a strict security check just before entering the main temple area. There were drinking water tanks in every 100 mtrs distance. And free food items were offered to the people while in the queue.
 
 
 
 On the way, we saw many waiting rooms which were locked. Other days, the devotees are released from these rooms slot by slot, to make queues. The most important entrance of the place, where the statue of Lord Balaji is kept, aadat se majbur people were pushing forward for no reason, though there were not lots many people. Basav, from his previous experience suggested us to keep ourselves extreme right so that we could see the statue without any distraction. Luckily, I managed to keep some gap in the last moment, while hubby picked son on his shoulders and the divine moment stayed with me for at least 15 seconds while I kept my eyes on the most desired statue at sanctum sanctorum.
 
 
 
 While coming out from that space, there is another chamber where one can write his/her wish with a coin and drop that coin there itself. When the secret wish accomplishes, the person has to come back to say aThanksa.
 
 Prasad in the form of Ladoo is available outside the temple premise. Two free ladoos which are very tasty, prepared with ghee and dry fruits are given per Sheegra darshan ticket. Each extra ladoo costs Rs 25. There is free food service also, but we were so tired that we could not eat it.
 
 
 
 So, coming out from the main temple, there is another temple of Hanumanji. One can break a coconut and devote there. One thing, I noticed is that, you wonat hesitate to sit on the floor anywhere inside the campus, as it was very clean.
 
 
 
 There are many food stalls, and lines of shops, where the stuff were not so costly, be it home dA(c)cor, idols, devotional items or cloth.
 
 
 
 Lovely experience it wasa|..Lucky was me as I did not have to give up half the way, not had to face crowd, and above all, had a longer glimpse of Lord Balaji!","Can we plan for Tirupati Balaji Mandir on 17th ?a An unexpected noon phone call from Hubby.

"Happiness is so interesting, because we all have different ideas about what it is and how to get it. Itas also no surprise that itas the Nr.1 value for Bufferas culture, if you see our slidedeck about it. So naturally we are obsessed with it.
 
 I would love to be happier, as Iam sure most people would, so I thought it would be interesting to find some ways to become a happier person that are actually backed up by science. Here are ten of the best ones I found.
 
 1. Exercise more a 7 minutes might be enough
 
 You might have seen some talk recently about the scientific 7 minute workout mentioned in The New York Times. So if you thought exercise was something you didnat have time for, maybe you can fit it in after all.
 
 Exercise has such a profound effect on our happiness and well-being that itas actually been proven to be an effective strategy for overcoming depression. In a study cited in Shawn Achoras book, The Happiness Advantage 1, three groups of patients treated their depression with either medication, exercise, or a combination of the two. The results of this study really surprised me. Although all three groups experienced similar improvements in their happiness levels to begin with, the follow up assessments proved to be radically different:
 
 The groups were then tested six months later to assess their relapse rate. Of those who had taken the medication alone, 38 percent had slipped back into depression. Those in the combination group were doing only slightly better, with a 31 percent relapse rate. The biggest shock, though, came from the exercise group: Their relapse rate was only 9 percent!
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 You donat have to be depressed to gain benefit from exercise, though. It can help you to relax, increase your brain power and even improve your body image, even if you donat lose any weight.
 
 A study in the Journal of Health Psychology 2 found that people who exercised felt better about their bodies, even when they saw no physical changes:
 
 Body weight, shape and body image were assessed in 16 males and 18 females before and after both 6 A 40 mins exercise and 6 A 40 mins reading. Over both conditions, body weight and shape did not change. Various aspects of body image, however, improved after exercise compared to before.
 
 Weave explored exercise in depth before, and looked at what it does to our brains, such as releasing proteins and endorphins that make us feel happier, as you can see in the image below.
 
 make yourself happier - exercise
 
 2. Sleep more a youall be less sensitive to negative emotions
 
 We know that sleep helps our bodies to recover from the day and repair themselves, and that it helps us focus and be more productive. It turns out, itas also important for our happiness.
 
 In NutureShock 3, Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman explain how sleep affects our positivity:
 
 Negative stimuli get processed by the amygdala; positive or neutral memories gets processed by the hippocampus. Sleep deprivation hits the hippocampus harder than the amygdala. The result is that sleep-deprived people fail to recall pleasant memories, yet recall gloomy memories just fine.
 
 
 
 In one experiment by Walker, sleep-deprived college students tried to memorize a list of words. They could remember 81% of the words with a negative connotation, like acancer.a But they could remember only 31% of the words with a positive or neutral connotation, like asunshinea or abasket.a
 
 The BPS Research Digest explores another study 4 that proves sleep affects our sensitivity to negative emotions. Using a facial recognition task over the course of a day, the researchers studied how sensitive participants were to positive and negative emotions. Those who worked through the afternoon without taking a nap became more sensitive late in the day to negative emotions like fear and anger.
 
 Using a face recognition task, here we demonstrate an amplified reactivity to anger and fear emotions across the day, without sleep. However, an intervening nap blocked and even reversed this negative emotional reactivity to anger and fear while conversely enhancing ratings of positive (happy) expressions.
 
 Of course, how well (and how long) you sleep will probably affect how you feel when you wake up, which can make a difference to your whole day. Especially this graph showing how your brain activity decreases is a great insight about how important enough sleep is for productivity and happiness:
 
 make yourself happier
 
 Another study 5 tested how employeesa moods when they started work in the morning affected their work day.
 
 Researchers found that employeesa moods when they clocked in tended to affect how they felt the rest of the day. Early mood was linked to their perceptions of customers and to how they reacted to customersa moods.
 
 
 
 And most importantly to managers, employee mood had a clear impact on performance, including both how much work employees did and how well they did it.
 
 Sleep is another topic weave looked into before, exploring how much sleep we really need to be productive.
 
 3. Move closer to work a a short commute is worth more than a big house
 
 Our commute to the office can have a surprisingly powerful impact on our happiness. The fact that we tend to do this twice a day, five days a week, makes it unsurprising that its effect would build up over time and make us less and less happy.","Happiness is so interesting, because we all have different ideas about what it is and how to get it.

"I was having lunch with my family. Since my childhood we have a pattern in our home, first everybody at our home has lunch while my mother serves and while we are on our last Roti she too joins with her plate.

As i don't know what to do even i was also fully tried, somehow i managed to take her to hospital and later she delivered a baby girl. That was my first time carrying a new born baby in my hand where i forgot all my tiredness'and i was also appreciated by the doctor that i had brought my aunty at the right time nor she would have been in a critical situation.","this incident had happened last two months back.I lived in a joint family, i was aged 22yrs and i was working as a sales executive and i use to reach home around 6.30pm everyday as my office timing was 9am - 6pm, when i reached home that evening i saw my aunty crying with pain as she was pregnant and there were no one at home as she was alone.

A close friend had been thinking of extensive cosmetic plastic surgery because her husband had left her for a younger woman and I was so afraid of the possble complications but didn't want to be too intrusive so I was very relieved when she said our frequent talks had cleared her head and made her see that she's a pretty woman who doesn't need surgical help.,A close friend had been thinking of extensive cosmetic plastic surgery because her husband had left her for a younger woman and I was so afraid of the possible complications but didn't want to be too intrusive so I was very relieved when she said our frequent talks had cleared her head and made her see that she's a pretty woman who doesn't need surgical help.

"My wife and I had a rather dry spell in terms of our intimacy. Money is tight, trying to save for a remodel, kids are sick, wife has an on-going ailment, so our stress levels have been high. We were getting on each others nerves alot. Well her parents surprised us last weekend and took the kids. We spent the day together, getting coffee, cleaning house, drinking on the deck. We really connected all day. Then we had sex better than we have ever. In fact, all our moments together in the last week have been amazing. People say it gets better with age and I can attest.","My wife and I had a rather dry spell in terms of our intimacy.

"The last small thing that made me surprisingly happy was spending time with my grandma.I went through a phase in my life where I wanted complete autonomy from my family. I felt crushed by the pressures of trying to pursue a career my family wanted from me rather than one I wanted for myself. So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasnat until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I havenat made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores. I didnat expect it to make me as happy as I had planned, but it really made my day. Iam really glad I did that and I certainly plan to spend a lot more time with her now.","The last small thing that made me surprisingly happy was spending time with my grandma.I went through a phase in my life where I wanted complete autonomy from my family.

"Recently My sister came to India to Visit us. But For a quite while even before she visiting us, she has been suffering with few pains in her wrist. Initially she thought it was just due to workload. So When She came to India, she consulted our family Doctor . He reported after few scannings that she has Giant Bone Tumour (Giant-cell tumor of bone - Wikipedia) in her hand and Some Organisms have already eaten some part of her bone. So we quickly without any further delay Planned for Operation in which some part of Necessary Bone from leg will be taken and that part will be fixed in hand after removing the tumour she had. Later they thought fixing it with artificial Bone. On the day of Operation,We all family members were waiting outside while her operation was going on. Then Came Doctor and Said they needed Blood ( B+) because of the blood loss she had during operation it was making her hard to breath. I and along with My sister's Brother-in-law Rushed to Blood Bank, I decided to be the Donor , But they initially needed to check my Blood group and all that safety measures which took around 20 Minutes and They Needed Blood Soon and I Quickly Started pumping my Blood Out and Finally Reached the hospital and handed over it to them and the Operation took Place Successfully.

"My much awaited desired prolonged Velankanni trip.
 
 
 
 One of the greatest pleasures of being in Chennai is your proximity to a lot of one day getawaysa| and nothing more exciting than planning a trip.
 
 
 
 Even though we are in the first quarter of the year I have exhausted my leaves due to our clichA(c) dialogue apersonal issuesa.
 
 
 
 Now that canat stop me from holidaying ;-)
 
 
 
 When I sat down to plan the places to visit on my bucket list the first one that popped up was Velankanni, to visit the shrine of lady of good health.
 
 
 
 In times of sickness this was always on my mind that when I get back to optimum health I will go and stand face to face with this mother as a sign of gratitude.
 
 
 
 Hailing from down south in Kerala the trips to Velankanni were often registered as tedious, dirty, long trips.
 
 
 
 I decided to create a better memory and enjoy my trip.
 
 
 
 I did my research on climate to start with, modes of transport, hotels food, mass timings, and other tourist spots around Velankanni.
 
 
 
 For the last two weeks I have been doing my research on the internet about Velankanni and speaking to the best hotels available for tariffs.
 
 
 
 Something or the other came up and my two day leaves were not working out.
 
 
 
 I planned a one day trip.
 
 
 
 Departure - 10pm Chennai the busy Koyembedu bus stand
 
 
 
 Arrival at the holy soil a 4.30 am.
 
 
 
 I rushed back from my hectic weekend at work and quickly packed my backpack with clothes and other necessities, cookies to munch on and water.
 
 
 
 Not to give extra strain on my back I preferred a Sleeper bus. There were hardly buses to Velankanni (surprisingly).I took a non a/c sleeper bus as A/c was not available. The humidity currently is beyond words could explain. I kept my fingers crossed that I should not fall ill or claustrophobic in the bus.
 
 
 
 I thanked all the bloggers and their wonderful reviews which were so helpful choose the bus and hotel I wanted to stay in.
 
 
 
 I would be using the hotel only during the day to refresh and catch some sleep which I have been deprived of.
 
 
 
 Koyembedu and travel from that super busy noisy bus stand was not new to me. I sat down waiting for my bus and remembered my college days of how reckless and daring I was to walk in to koyembedu buy a random ticket to Nagercoil and further take buses to Trivandrum.
 
 
 
 Today in spite of all the planning I was worried,
 
 
 
 The bus reminded me of a fish .Tall and sleek and way too silvery.
 
 
 
 Even though these thoughts happen on my thought bubble I laugh out loud, followed by an embarrassment.
 
 
 
 The sleeper was an upper berth and had sliding windows. The bus started to move and the air fought to gush in.
 
 
 
 I didnat want to reach velaknni at 4.30.I prayed hard for a delay in departure contradicting to the prayers of fellow passengers.
 
 
 
 I had a small talk with the bus driver and conductor and asked him if he could drop me at amathakulama(this was the landmark the hotel reception gave me.
 
 
 
 After a long halt at a toll before reaching Velankanni the bus pulls in to Velankanni by 5.30.The sun was out and I was a happy child. A proactive bus conductor asks for a couple of directions and drops me at VPN hotel in Matakulam or Our ladyas tank.
 
 
 
 The bookings we done prior to my visit and they offered 10% discount plus complimentary breakfast after my sweet talk and enquiries.
 
 
 
 The hotel was relatively new and the rooms were spotlessly clean .
 
 
 
 I hit the bed and woke up at 8.30am.A quick shower and nibbled through a bit of everything on the buffet, took my camera and stood outside the hotel.
 
 
 
 Being very enthusiastic and experimental that morning, I took a shortcut to walk to our ladyas tank.
 
 
 
 I walked and walked through a dry dusty road with no signs of a tank. Occasionally there was a signage pointing to the direction I was walking to. I finally reached my destination. There were trees with cradles tied all over with bright yellow threads.
 
 
 
 There was the tank with a metal covering and a cross and Hail Mary stencilled on it. I could look through the small holes and see a reflection of it in the water beneath.
 
 
 
 I walked towards the Shrine of our lady of Good health and by then the sun was at its peak. Sipped from a bottle of water I was carrying and I could see devotees crawling towards the tank from the church as a belief. I saw an exhausted woman in the verge of collapsing on the sand. She drank water from my bottle and I proceeded to the church. There was a malayalam mass happening at that time and I took that as a sign from Mother Mary Welcoming me to her abode.
 
 
 
 I sat on the floor outside as the church was full of Malayalam speaking devotees. Post the service I entered the church and I quickly tried to remember the names I had registered in my mind of people who needed special blessings.
 
 
 
 I felt that I was pressurised to pray and not to forget.
 
 
 
 I did my generalised template of prayer and prayed for My parents, grandparents, uncles ,aunts, cousins, their children, relatives, neighbours in all houses I have lived in, people I have met in all cities that I have lived in, my school, colleges, juniors , seniors , classmates, faculties, teachers, mentors, guides,doctors,people who are unwell, troubled, colleagues at work, bosses.
 
 
 
 I have always found myself in a very difficult spot trying to pray in a busy church. I never get a Holy feeling or connect.
 
 
 
 There is always suffering around.
 
 
 
 Visited a museum near the church with pictorial depiction of how mother Mary appeared to the milk man .The church was founded its founding is attributed to three miracles: the apparition of Mary and Jesus to a slumbering shepherd boy, the curing of a lame buttermilk vendor, and the survival of Portuguese sailors assaulted by a violent sea storm.
 
 
 
 I walked through the dirty crowded humid roads with fruit, shell, and pirated CD vendors and reached the beach.
 
 
 
 The sipped some tender coconut water and clicked a few pictures of the ocean.
 
 
 
 I ate raw mangoes and cashew apple.
 
 
 
 The resinous cashew juice burnt my stomach as I walked back to where I could take a rickshaw back to the hotel. I ordered food to the room and slept. I was content that a long term dream came true and I was relaxed after the good sleep and food at the hotel.
 
 
 
 I lay on the upper berth looking at the beautiful full moon from the window and the wind stroking my hair getting recaps of the day which has gone bya|in spirituality and relaxation. I would probably not want to go back to Velankanni but I have memories well etched.","My much awaited desired prolonged Velankanni trip.
 
 
 
 One of the greatest pleasures of being in Chennai is your proximity to a lot of one day getawaysa| and nothing more exciting than planning a trip.
 
 
 
 Even though we are in the first quarter of the year I have exhausted my leaves due to our clichA(c) dialogue personal issuesa.
 
 
 
 Now that canat stop me from holidaying ;-)
 
 
 
 When I sat down to plan the places to visit on my bucket list the first one that popped up was Velankanni, to visit the shrine of lady of good health.
 
 
 
 In times of sickness this was always on my mind that when I get back to optimum health I will go and stand face to face with this mother as a sign of gratitude.
 
 
 
 Hailing from down south in Kerala the trips to Velankanni were often registered as tedious, dirty, long trips.
 
 
 
 I decided to create a better memory and enjoy my trip.
 
 
 
 I did my research on climate to start with, modes of transport, hotels food, mass timings, and other tourist spots around Velankanni.
 
 
 
 For the last two weeks I have been doing my research on the internet about Velankanni and speaking to the best hotels available for tariffs.
 
 
 
 Something or the other came up and my two day leaves were not working out.
 
 
 
 I planned a one day trip.
 
 
 
 Departure - 10pm Chennai the busy Koyembedu bus stand
 
 
 
 Arrival at the holy soil a 4.30 am.
 
 
 
 I rushed back from my hectic weekend at work and quickly packed my backpack with clothes and other necessities, cookies to munch on and water.
 
 
 
 Not to give extra strain on my back I preferred a Sleeper bus. There were hardly buses to Velankanni (surprisingly).I took a non a/c sleeper bus as A/c was not available. The humidity currently is beyond words could explain. I kept my fingers crossed that I should not fall ill or claustrophobic in the bus.
 
 
 
 I thanked all the bloggers and their wonderful reviews which were so helpful choose the bus and hotel I wanted to stay in.
 
 
 
 I would be using the hotel only during the day to refresh and catch some sleep which I have been deprived of.
 
 
 
 Koyembedu and travel from that super busy noisy bus stand was not new to me. I sat down waiting for my bus and remembered my college days of how reckless and daring I was to walk in to koyembedu buy a random ticket to Nagercoil and further take buses to Trivandrum.
 
 
 
 Today in spite of all the planning I was worried,
 
 
 
 The bus reminded me of a fish .Tall and sleek and way too silvery.
 
 
 
 Even though these thoughts happen on my thought bubble I laugh out loud, followed by an embarrassment.
 
 
 
 The sleeper was an upper berth and had sliding windows. The bus started to move and the air fought to gush in.
 
 
 
 I didnt want to reach velaknni at 4.30.I prayed hard for a delay in departure contradicting to the prayers of fellow passengers.

 Weare starting a new series on the Buffer blog today with great tips and insights from Joel, CEO here at Buffer. Joel will share his ideas and insights about lifehacking, building a business and working on company culture. Here is #1:
 
 Today itas a little over three years since I first had the idea for Buffer, and with the year and a half before that which I worked on my previous startup, Iave started to notice a few patterns amongst the ups and downs that come with building a startup.
 
 One of the most important things Iave learned during this time is that I perform the best when Iam happy. It really does change everything. If Iam happy then Iam more productive when hacking code, Iam better at answering support, and I find it easier to stay focused.
 
 Iave found that there are a few key habits which, for me, act as great rituals for enabling me to be consistently happy. They also act as anchor activities to bring my happiness level back up quickly whenever I have a period where Iam not feeling 100%. So here are 6 of the things I do:
 
 1. Wake up early
 
 One of the things I love about running my own startup is that I have complete freedom to experiment with my daily routine.
 
 Through experimentation, Iave found that waking up early every day makes me feel most invigorated and happy. It gives me a great start to the day, and this almost always leads to a great rest of the day. Over time, Iave found I crave that aearly morninga feeling, a time I can do some great work and be super focused. Gretchen Rubin from The Happiness Project mentioned something similar a recent article:
 
 aI get up at 6:00 a.m. every day, even on weekends and vacation, because I love it.a
 
 Waking up early every day requires discipline, especially about what time I sleep. Right now, I have a sleep ritual of disengaging from the day at 9:30pm and sleeping at 10pm. I now love all aspects of this ritual and with it in place I awake at 6am feeling fresh.
 
 The power with your mornings is that you will have about 25,000 of them in your life, so thereas a lot of room to experiment.
 
 2. Exercise daily
 
 aWe found that people who are more physically active have more pleasant-activated feelings than people who are less activea a Amanda Hyde
 
 In the last three years, Iave gone from dabbling with exercise to it becoming something I do every weekday without fail. At first I had no idea what to do at the gym, so I asked my brother, whoas a personal trainer. I then went a few times with a good friend and soon I was hooked.
 
 Over time, I developed this into a daily ritual so strong that I feel a pull towards it, and by doing it consistently I feel fantastic and can more easily take on other challenges. I recently discovered that exercise is a keystone habit which paves the way for growth in all other areas. Iave also found that it helps me to get high quality sleep each night.
 
 3. Have a habit of disengagement
 
 aThe richest, happiest and most productive lives are characterized by the ability to fully engage in the challenge at hand, but also to disengage periodically and seek renewala a Loehr and Schwarz, The Power of Full Engagement
 
 As I mentioned earlier, a key way I am able to wake up at 6am is through my ritual of disengaging in the evening. I go for a walk at 9:30pm, along a route which Iave done many times before. Since the route is already decided and is the same every time, I am simply walking and doing nothing else. This prompts reflection and relaxation.","happy

Last week as he was getting ready for bed, I gave him a hug and kiss as normal, but this time it was more than the regular routine. We actually stood in our bedroom, making out like a couple of teenagers for a few minutes. The spark we felt generally reconnected us. I't is completely unexplainable, but certainly welcomed.","My husband and I have been struggling with the new move and new job, as a result we haven't really connected emotionally in a while.

"The last small thing that made me surprisingly happy was spending time with my grandma.I went through a phase in my life where I wanted complete autonomy from my family. I felt crushed by the pressures of trying to pursue a career my family wanted from me rather than one I wanted for myself. So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasnat until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I havenat made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores. I didnat expect it to make me as happy as I had planned, but it really made my day. Iam really glad I did that and I certainly plan to spend a lot more time with her now.","The last small thing that made me surprisingly happy was spending time with my grandma.I went through a phase in my life where I wanted complete autonomy from my family.

"Everyone has their own magical moments. For some of them, it can be a huge achievement, and for others, it may be a simple thing, which makes their day brighter. 
 
 
 
 The greatest magical moment of mine is when I meet an old, dear friend, who I have not seen for a long time. Firstly it is marvellous to notice differences in a friendas appearance and compare it with how he has looked in my memories and how he has changed since the last time we met.
 
 
 
 Then I feel like a different person, because all wonderful memories flow in my mind and I can talk with my old friend about anything; we can share the best moments of our friendship or our plans for the future. During the meeting we cannot stop smiling and pouring positive emotions to each other. I feel crazily happy because we have finally met. This is obviously the main reason, why this moment is magical.

"He left my school when we were kids and went to boys boarding school. He came in contact with lot of our classmates through fb. And he even visits our school whenever he comes to the town. He insisted on meeting with me.. I knew he was a decent person and doesn't speaks much., a gentleman ,very intelligent, good looking, Never been in any relationship. We met near my house then for sometime after so many years.. His reaction was normal.. We hugged..It was good. Then he got into NDA, so he visits his home every 6 months. We met this December twice and spended a day together. 
 
 now here is the real thing.. He likes holding my hand a lot.. whether we were walking or were in the metro... He wasn't ready to let go of my hand. We went to movie together , there too he was holding my hand all the time.. and a few times he even kind of kissed my hand. He himself told me that he likes it when i asked him jokingly that whats with this holding hands. 
 
  i found it weird because though he was treating me special but these things I didn't understand because I don't think he thinks of me that way. I'm not able to understand his psychology. Maybe he's a despo? Or pervert? Now he wants to meet again this time when he will come.","He left my school when we were kids and went to boys boarding school.

"when I was in Armenia, my cousin came from the States to visit me and my family, and after returning back from Armenia, she was still in town. It was a nice that she was in town all summer, now then when she flew back that was the last time I saw her. We havenat seen each other in more than a decade in this april, 2017, we will finally reunite. It will be an emotional yet exciting feeling and I bet you we wonat stop hugging each other. Were both so excited. The reason why we couldnat see each other since then was because of the constant schooling between the both of us among other things, but this year is the year that it will happen again. I still remember her sound and the ways she was with me, but I am sure things may have changed because we are much older. Were about 2 years between each other and were like sisters. We try to keep in touch with each other often from Facebook and among other social networking sites and as well as communicating on the phone. She is such a sweetheart. I cannot wait for all the cousins to gather have a huge family reunion at my cousins wedding. A nice picture is required for sure. October seems so far away, but I am not counting the days anymore and going with the flow. I donat want to put myself in all that because its something that I am trying to get better at with patience with going on trips and looking forward to them. I need to cool off on that, but I get so excited and this is going to be extra special because I will see my cousin and it will be one of the best trips ever in my life because its a family reunion.","when I was in Armenia, my cousin came from the States to visit me and my family, and after returning back from Armenia, she was still in town.

"Itas a trip to Kanyakumari from Bangalore. Kanyakumari is the southernmost tip of mainland India and is surrounded by three water bodies. Bay of Bengal towards east, Indian Ocean in south and Arabian Sea in west. I think it is the only place to see sun rise and sun set in water bodies in India. Kanyakumari town is named after the goddess Kanyakumari amman, a popular deity of the area. Legend has it that the goddess Parvathi in one of her incarnation as devi Kanya did penance on one of the rock of this landas end to obtain the hand of lord Siva. Tip of the day a Never ever wear any footwear which is difficult to open in Kanyakumari like sneakers or other shoes. Every place you visit, you have to open your shoe even in museum. 2nd tip of the day a Always wear socks to protect your feet from heat. 3rd tip a Protect yourself with best sunscreen lotion you have. 4th one a everybody speaks Hindi. 5th one a Hardly any non veg restaurant. Everyone is veg and I figured out only one non veg which became my favorite. Ok ok lots of free trip.
 
 
 
 Its 22-March-2017 10:30 PM, we have boarded Nagercoil Express in Bangalore City Junction station. Since this train does not have any pantry, we had to get packed food. When I am traveling I am always double hungry than normal days. The train was full, but it was totally empty once it reached Madurai next day at 10:00 am. Runai and I were thinking whether the train will go till Nagercoil or not. Then I saw there was another family far end in the same coach.
 
 
 
 We reached Nagercoil Junction station at 23-March-2012 2:30 pm. We came out of the station and saw lots of taxi waiting to take you to Kanyakumari. We know that they are going to take you on a ride if we hire them, so thought of taking a bus because it 20 KM from Nagercoil to Kanyakumari. There lots of local public bus very frequent to go to Kanyakumari. But then I came to know that it will take 2 hours to reach in this type of bus because it will go everywhere and will stop in every place. One person told us that if we walk a kilometer from there to reach highway, then we will get direct express bus for Kanyakumari and will take hardly 20 min to reach. Along with us there were another family who came to highway road bus stop. After waiting for 10 min, a bus came and we boarded that bus. Ticket was Rs. 18 per head and we reached Kanyakumari around 3:30 pm. We asked one fellow passenger to drop us in Kanyakumari Railway station. I had a printed google map of all the places from Kanyakumari Railway station. Anyway we got down and saw that itas the entrance for Our Lady of Ransom Church.
 
 
 
 We decided to go to the church and then search for hotel. We did that promptly. Itas a beautiful church. A bit of information about this church a Located on the shoreline of the Bay of Bengal, the 100 year old Church in dedicated to Mother Mary. It was built in the Gothic style of architecture with a strong Portuguese influence. It is 153 feet high and is crowned with a cross of pure gold. One lady near the entrance asked me if I know Tamil and I replied yes. May be she knows only Tamil and wanted to communicate something important. She told me that behind the church, there is a staircase and on top there is a new smaller church build and we also get to see beautiful view of Bay of Bengal from the terrace. We opened our shoe and went inside the church. Interior was very simple just opposite to the decoration on outside. Then we went backstage and went to that new church which was pretty small and from the terrace we can see the beautiful sea. We could not take any picture because we did not yet open our luggage.
 
 
 
 Next was our hotel search. Tell you something, if there are 100 houses for local resident, then there are 1000 hotels for tourist. So we decided to go near the beach and get a hotel. In the midway we found a budget Hotel Sangam. We wanted to enguire the rate and they told Rs. 1300 and 1000 for A/C and Non A/C double bed. We told its too much and we were about to leave and the receptionist told us, that they have room for Rs 600. Basically itas the same room and since it is off season, they lower the rate and I instantly booked it for 3 days. After refreshing we went to the restaurant downstairs. We did not wanted something fancy so ordered for 2 plates of lunch meal. Tell you something, I donat know what they gave in food but I till late night I was not hungry. So we decided that we are not going to go in that restaurant anymore.
 
 
 
 We headed toward Triveny Sangam (which is the meeting point of three water bodies). I am confused here. Till now I know that there are 3 different Triveny Sangam (one near Srirangapatnam, another near Coorg and next is this one). If a traveler ask for Triveny Sangam details, where will the person refer to? Anyway itas a rocky place and no sea beach as such. There are plenty of shops for sea shells and they are pretty cheap AMO. Big shells were for Rs. 200 whereas in Chennai they are sold for min Rs. 500 for bad quality ones. We can have a so-so view for sun rise and sun set from here with lots of obstacles. After the sun set and few photographs, we left the place.","Itas a trip to Kanyakumari from Bangalore.

I think it is the only place to see sun rise and sun set in water bodies in India. Kanyakumari town is named after the goddess Kanyakumari amman, a popular deity of the area. Legend has it that the goddess Parvathi in one of her incarnation as devi Kanya did penance on one of the rock of this landas end to obtain the hand of lord Siva. Tip of the day a Never ever wear any footwear which is difficult to open in Kanyakumari like sneakers or other shoes. Every place you visit, you have to open your shoe even in museum. 2nd tip of the day a Always wear socks to protect your feet from heat. 3rd tip a Protect yourself with best sunscreen lotion you have. 4th one a everybody speaks Hindi. 5th one a Hardly any non veg restaurant. Everyone is veg and I figured out only one non veg which became my favorite. Ok ok lots of free trip.
 
 
 
 Its 22-March-2017 10:30 PM, we have boarded Nagercoil Express in Bangalore City Junction station. Since this train does not have any pantry, we had to get packed food. When I am traveling I am always double hungry than normal days. The train was full, but it was totally empty once it reached Madurai next day at 10:00 am. Runai and I were thinking whether the train will go till Nagercoil or not. Then I saw there was another family far end in the same coach.
 
 
 
 We reached Nagercoil Junction station at 23-March-2012 2:30 pm. We came out of the station and saw lots of taxi waiting to take you to Kanyakumari. We know that they are going to take you on a ride if we hire them, so thought of taking a bus because it 20 KM from Nagercoil to Kanyakumari. There lots of local public bus very frequent to go to Kanyakumari. But then I came to know that it will take 2 hours to reach in this type of bus because it will go everywhere and will stop in every place. One person told us that if we walk a kilometer from there to reach highway, then we will get direct express bus for Kanyakumari and will take hardly 20 min to reach. Along with us there were another family who came to highway road bus stop. After waiting for 10 min, a bus came and we boarded that bus. Ticket was Rs. 18 per head and we reached Kanyakumari around 3:30 pm. We asked one fellow passenger to drop us in Kanyakumari Railway station. I had a printed google map of all the places from Kanyakumari Railway station. Anyway we got down and saw that itas the entrance for Our Lady of Ransom Church.
 
 
 
 We decided to go to the church and then search for hotel. We did that promptly. Itas a beautiful church. A bit of information about this church a Located on the shoreline of the Bay of Bengal, the 100 year old Church in dedicated to Mother Mary. It was built in the Gothic style of architecture with a strong Portuguese influence. It is 153 feet high and is crowned with a cross of pure gold. One lady near the entrance asked me if I know Tamil and I replied yes. May be she knows only Tamil and wanted to communicate something important. She told me that behind the church, there is a staircase and on top there is a new smaller church build and we also get to see beautiful view of Bay of Bengal from the terrace. We opened our shoe and went inside the church. Interior was very simple just opposite to the decoration on outside. Then we went backstage and went to that new church which was pretty small and from the terrace we can see the beautiful sea. We could not take any picture because we did not yet open our luggage.
 
 
 
 Next was our hotel search. Tell you something, if there are 100 houses for local resident, then there are 1000 hotels for tourist. So we decided to go near the beach and get a hotel. In the midway we found a budget Hotel Sangam. We wanted to enquire the rate and they told Rs. 1300 and 1000 for A/C and Non A/C double bed. We told its too much and we were about to leave and the receptionist told us, that they have room for Rs 600. Basically itas the same room and since it is off season, they lower the rate and I instantly booked it for 3 days. After refreshing we went to the restaurant downstairs. We did not wanted something fancy so ordered for 2 plates of lunch meal. Tell you something, I donat know what they gave in food but I till late night I was not hungry. So we decided that we are not going to go in that restaurant anymore.
 
 
 
 We headed toward Triveny Sangam (which is the meeting point of three water bodies). I am confused here. Till now I know that there are 3 different Triveny Sangam (one near Srirangapatnam, another near Coorg and next is this one). If a traveler ask for Triveny Sangam details, where will the person refer to? Anyway itas a rocky place and no sea beach as such. There are plenty of shops for sea shells and they are pretty cheap AMO. Big shells were for Rs. 200 whereas in Chennai they are sold for min Rs. 500 for bad quality ones. We can have a so-so view for sun rise and sun set from here with lots of obstacles. After the sun set and few photographs, we left the place."

"The last small thing that made me surprisingly happy was spending time with my grandma.I went through a phase in my life where I wanted complete autonomy from my family. I felt crushed by the pressures of trying to pursue a career my family wanted from me rather than one I wanted for myself. So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasnat until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I havenat made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores. I didnat expect it to make me as happy as I had planned, but it really made my day. Iam really glad I did that and I certainly plan to spend a lot more time with her now.","The last small thing that made me surprisingly happy was spending time with my grandma.I went through a phase in my life where I wanted complete autonomy from my family.

"This poem of Drydenas, aOne Happy Moment,a is a very intense and sensual love poem to another person. To begin, the poem opens with the statement: aNo, no poor suffaring Heart, no Change endeavour / Choose to sustain the smart, rather than leave hera (lines 1-2). The speaker instantly creates a tone that he has suffered from the difficulties of love in the past (apoor suffraing Hearta and aravishad eyes) but how he now cannot keep himself away from this woman (lines 1-3). Dryden explicitly states that he would adie with hera just to anot live without hera due to her intoxicating charms, which connects to a common characteristic surrounding love in literature at this time: the heart is so infatuated with another it will disregard everything just to be with that person","This poem of Drydenas, aOne Happy Moment,a is a very intense and sensual love poem to another person.

"Before I start with the second thing I must tell you that I am a passionate traveller and I love going to places where very last amount of people go or knows. It was 14th of April and we were just sitting and thinking of where to go this weekend. I researched a bit and planned a trip to Maaldevta WaterFall which is in Dehradun, Uttrakhand(India). Everyone agreed and we took off. Its a 2 hours drive from our place and after reaching to a point you have to go on a trail which takes you through a dense forest. At first we went on a wrong path and after going on about 2-300 mtrs on an inclined path which is about 7o degree angle our sixth sense kicked in and we realised we are going on a wrong path. We came back and started started again. After walking for about 20-25 minutes we got a glipse and sound of the waterfall. I can't tell you how beautiful it was. We increased or pace and when I got the full view of the waterfall I just stold there completely still admiring its beauty. It was so mesmering that I can never forget it my entire lifetime.","Before I start with the second thing I must tell you that I am a passionate traveller and I love going to places where very last amount of people go or knows.

"It was my second visit to Guruvayur, one of the famous spiritual destinations of Kerala. First I went before my marriage with my entire family with a bundle of personal demands to plead in front of Vasudeva, lord who had rescued his devotees from Demons and miseries. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I was excited with the ambiance of the temple and its surroundings. That was first experience in my life. This great temple is well-known for its epic stories related to its origin and its devotees. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 It was my two years planning to go once more to Guruvayur but due to several reasons I have been postponing it. This was my word to come once more to Guruvayur. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We started our journey from Thekkady on early morning in my car. The distance from Thekkady to Guruvayur is 210 km and 5.30 hrs journey. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Thrissur is well-known as cultural capital of Kerala. Thrissur is famous for its temples; Vadakkumnathan Temple, Thiruvambadi Sri Krishna Temple, Paramekkavu Temple and Guruvayur Temple. Thrissur Pooram is world renowned one because of its peculiarities. It was also considered as the spiritual and cultural destination of Kerala. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 My mind was filled with joy and excitement that I enjoyed from my first visit. My grandfather, who died before ten years, was the motivation behind my spirituality. But he was a complete devotee of Lord Shiva. He used to wake on early morning and do chants of Lord Shiva. He was truly innocent and never uttered a hard word against anyone. He taught me to chant the mantras of Lord Shiva, Dakshinamurthy, the Guru of this universe. I have been practicing this from the age of fourteen but after I went to Bangalore it was stopped. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We entered to Thrissur town at 6 oaclock morning. My grandmother reminded me, aWe are near to Vadakkumnathan Templea. I asked to a pedestrian, he showed me the way to Vadakkumnatha Temple. The temple is encircled by Thekkinkadu Maidan where Thrissur Pooram is conducting every year. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We entered to the temple after parking my car on parking ground. The security person warned me against entering with my six month old baby. According to beliefs children below one year of age are not permitted to enter in temples like Lord Shiva and Bhadra kali. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 It is a big Temple by its surroundings and minor deities are located each corner of the temple. We entered in front of the sanctum sanctorum (Sree Kovil). It was my first time visit to a famous Shiva Temple in Kerala. The ambiance of the temple and its surroundings are quite astonishing one for any devotee. When we finished our prayers we came out of the central entrance. We saw a person approximately at an age of 40 standing in front of the main entrance and chanting the mantras written on the board placed near there. I felt the voice that coming from the bottom of his heart and each and every ending of those stanzas he was raising his hands and praising Lord Shiva. The transcendental spiritual vibrations embraced me for some time. I felt my grandfather was with me that moment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Time went a lot, we were wanted to go Guruvayur the prime destination of us but we forget it for some time. I have drove fast to get rid of the traffic. We reached at 9 oaclock in Guruvayur. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The much awaited visit, but I was exhausted with confession. The crowd was almost double compared to my previous visit. After Nivedyam we entered to central shrine Lord Krishna in Balakrishna form. I felt myself awful that I could not keep my words. I started my journey to see Guruvayurappan but instantly changed everything. After prayers we went to Mammiyoor, temple of Lord Shiva. We were stayed one day in Guruvayur and after seeing Nirmalyam we returned from Guruvayur to home. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I drove my car with a disturbed mind but after sometime I remembered my grandfather's words aLord Shiva and Vishnu are different forms of Supreme God aheada. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Next time I have planned go Guruvayur first, but I do not know what will happen when I see Vadakkumnathan Temple in the midst of the city of Thrissur.","It was my second visit to Guruvayur, one of the famous spiritual destinations of Kerala.

 The much awaited visit, but I was exhausted with confession. The crowd was almost double compared to my previous visit. After Nivedyam we entered to central shrine Lord Krishna in Balakrishna form. I felt myself awful that I could not keep my words. I started my journey to see Guruvayurappan but instantly changed everything. After prayers we went to Mammiyoor, temple of Lord Shiva. We were stayed one day in Guruvayur and after seeing Nirmalyam we returned from Guruvayur to home. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I drove my car with a disturbed mind but after sometime I remembered my grandfather's words aLord Shiva and Vishnu are different forms of Supreme God aheada. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Next time I have planned go Guruvayur first, but I do not know what will happen when I see Vadakkumnathan Temple in the midst of the city of Thrissur."

"About a month ago I gave birth in the most peaceful way. Before I was even pregnant my husband and I decided on a middle name for our little boy that actually means peace; isnat that interesting? It makes me so happy to experience a birth without the medical chaos my last one had. My last birth was a painful early (36 weeks) induction despite having an epidural (not what I had wanted)! This birth was a water birth without pain meds of any sort. I kept thinking it was going to be worse than it was, or I wasnat capable of doing this thing called childbirth without medication like my last. But to my utter surprise, it wasnat and was far easier and less painful than my first! Even my dear husband and midwives were impressed with my pain tolerance and joy and laughter between contractions that were apparently off the charts. It was an absolutely incredible and beautiful experience for both my husband and I. I wish I could do it every day; it made me that happy.","About a month ago I gave birth in the most peaceful way.

"Somehow I ended up with the best parents in the world. Iave always been grateful to have them, and I know that Iam the badass I am today in large part because of them.
 
 
 
 Most people would consider themselves fortunate to have great parents. However, I ended up with the coolest grandparents ever, as well. My last living grandparent died more than 16 years ago, but I think of all of them often.
 
 
 
 But I never had the opportunity to meet one of my grandparents. My dadas mom, Florence, died in 1979, six years before I was born. My grandpa George remarried shortly after my birth, and his second wife, a saintly, kind woman named Marie, became my grandma, and I loved her as much as all of my biological grandparents.
 
 
 
 Iave often wondered about Grandma Florence though.
 
 She was just fifty-seven years old when she died, and Iam ashamed to say that I donat remember if it was from ovarian cancer or cervical cancer. I think ovarian. Whatever the cause, she died way too young.
 
 
 
 But just because I never met her doesnat mean that she hasnat had an impact on my life. She has probably impacted my life more than any other person who Iave never met. That might not make sense, but let me explain.
 
 
 
 I donat remember how old I was when I learned that Grandpa George had a wife, and my dad had a mom, who Iad never met. I suspect I was six or seven-years-old, but I donat remember learning that information for the first time. It seems like something I always knew, even though Iam sure it isnat.
 
 
 
 I remember seeing pictures of her, and once visiting her grave. My sisteras middle name is Florence, and I knew why.
 
 
 
 The earliest impact that I recall Grandma Florence having on my life came one rainy night when I was nine or ten-years-old. My dad, my two sisters and I were in the car and joking around. I donat remember what we were talking about, but at some point the conversation turned to wishes. If we could have just one wish, what would it be?
 
 
 
 Iam sure my sisters and I wished for common kid stuff: a million dollars, school to be canceled, a TV in my room. Real dumb stuff to waste a wish on.
 
 
 
 And then we asked my dad what head wish for. And he said, aI wish my mom was still alive so she could meet you guys and see how proud I am of you.a
 
 
 
 Holy cow.
 
 
 
 The joking atmosphere in the car immediately became more somber, and I donat remember if any of us said anything. But I remember thinking to myself, aHe sure must love us if heas going to use his one wish for that.a
 
 
 
 I knew he loved us. Despite his occasional moodiness, none of us ever questioned that we were the most important part of his life. He and my mom told us they loved us often, and that they were glad to have us. But his wish just seemed to kick things up a notch.
 
 
 
 Since that night, whenever I think of Grandma Florence I think of that conversation in the car, and Iam reminded once again just how much my parents love us. And that never ending, unconditional love has provided so much support for me over the years that I have no doubt itas the foundation of every single positive thing I do in my life.
 
 
 
 I think itas also the reason that I feel such a devotion to my kids and to my wife. I know how it feels to never have to wonder if anyone loves you completely and unconditionally. Iave known that all my life. And I want them to know it, also. I never want them to wonder if thereas anyone who loves them so completely.
 
 
 
 In sixty-two days, on August 10, it will be the 100th anniversary of Grandma Florenceas birth. I donat know if anyone else has plans to celebrate it, but in my house weall get an ice cream cake, and weall sing Happy Birthday. And Iall tell my kids the few things I know about Grandma Florence, and Iall tell them the story of that night in the car.
 
 
 
 And Iall do my best to make them feel as loved as I did when I heard my dadas wish.","Somehow I ended up with the best parents in the world. Iave always been grateful to have them, and I know that Iam the badass I am today in large part because of them.

"The surprise started with a card from the post office put through my letter box. The card said that they had tried to deliver a parcel to me, but because I was out when they called they hadnat been able to leave it, so Iad have to go and pick it up from the parcel depot. I was intrigued. I hadnat ordered anything online, it wasnat my birthday, and I wasnat expecting anything exciting in the post at all. I had no idea what it could possibly be. The next morning I went to the post office with some ID to prove who I was, and collected the parcel. It was a box, about the size of a shoe box, wrapped in a dark grey plastic packaging, with the name of the company ablurta on it. I was none the wiser, I didnat recognise the company and couldnat tell who it was from by the wrapping. 
 
 
 
 I waited until I got home, and then I opened it. The parcel contained a brown cardboard box which said aBuddy Boxa on the outside. Inside, was a collection of rather random, but very charming gift items. They included a pair of socks made from bamboo; some rather strongly scented soap (I wasnat too sure about that!); a little blank pad of writing paper with a cover decorated with cactus plants, a asew your owna cactus kit (that was very bizarre) and an ultra-thin pen for sliding inside a diary or notebook! There was still no card to say who it was from, but just an anonymous typed note saying aI saw this and thought of you!a It was a completely unexpected gift, sent by someone, somewhere to cheer me up. Iad had a rather bad time recently following a bereavement and losing my job as well, so Iad been quite down, knowing that someone was thinking about me was really touching, and as well as being a surprise, made me very happy. The parcel came just a month ago, so it is a very recent surprise, but a lovely one.","The surprise started with a card from the post office put through my letter box.

"Iall start with the where and when, because that makes more sense of the story. It was a Saturday morning about two and a half years ago. I went down to my local park near to where I live in Sheffield, to take part in a 5km run which is a regular weekly event called Parkrun, which lots of people in the UK participate in, there are over 364 different Parkrun events held in open spaces across the UK so it is quite a phenomenon. This particular event is quite large, with around 500 runners - of all different ages, backgrounds and speeds a taking part. On this particular day, after the run I was walking away towards home when I suddenly saw a face I recognised. aHelloa, I said, ahello Lucya she replied, and that was the beginning of our reunion. The person Iad recognised was someone I had been at school with thirty years ago in a completely different part of the UK. When she finished school, shead moved away to Sheffield to study and made a home here, I hadnat kept in touch with her, so when I myself moved to Sheffield to take up a new job some 25 years later, I had no idea she lived in the same city. We met each other completely by chance after three decades, and recognised each other instantly. It was certainly a surprise! What made it even more unexpected, was that we were both taking part in a sporting activity. At school, neither of us had enjoyed physical education, or PE as it was then called, and quite often had skipped school to avoid it! It was so funny to us both that we should meet up after so long, at such an unlikely occasion and in a city hundreds of miles away from where we used to live as children. We went off for a aquicka coffee to catch up, and ended up talking solidly for over 3 hours!","Iall start with the where and when, because that makes more sense of the story.

I recieived a bonus for a Mturk survey.,I received a bonus for a Mturk survey.
"A few weeks ago i was in town and I bumped into an old maths teacher of mine. For this Blog I will call her Mrs A. Mrs A is quite a pleasant lady who always had a big smile and hello for me, which is kind of surprising and makes me feel a bit guilty for some of my behaviours towards her when i was at school. Back then I hated all teachers, the authorities. For me they were the enemy and Iam sure they didnat think much of me either. I recognise that I didnat give teachers an easy time I lacked the empathy and understanding to recognise that many teachers were just trying to do their best to do their job.
 
 
 
 That day in town Mrs A and I had an interesting conversation regarding ADHD. First of all we did the pleasantries, asking each other how we were, Mrs A explaining she had been retired for a number of years and then we briefly discussed how great it is to see the sun. In Co. Fermanagh it is always a topic of conversation if the sun comes out because it usually never stops raining. Then Mrs A asked me what I was working at these days and I explained that I was a founding director of Adult ADHD NI an organisation set up to support Adults and families affected by ADHD etc. etc.. Mrs A said awell done Niall, that sounds like good work your doinga. Then brightly laughing she said aisnat it funny in my day there was no ADHD we called them BOLD CHILDRENa
 
 
 
 Well I was glad she said it because I went on to tell her the following story, perhaps not quite as detailed, but she got the idea. It was actually Mrs Aas class that gave me a greatest understanding of how my school had failed me due to lack of knowledge or willingness to support students with various needs. It was in year 4 that i ended up in Mrs As math class. Mrs As math class was what ye called top maths at my school. The maths class for the brainy students, the students that got everything really easy and the students that automatically understood how a2 + b2 = c2. So what the hell was I doing there? I was still trying to work out when they started adding the alphabet to sums, I must have missed that day. The reason I was there was due to the teacher I had from the year before. For this Blog ill call her Mrs B.
 
 
 
 Mrs B was my ultimate nightmare. From the very first moment I met her at the door of her classroom Mrs B was screaming at me. At that particular moment she had no reason to scream at me but I can only assume that she had heard from other teachers that I had been a handful and she was not for taking any nonsense. Nonsense was my speciality, if I couldnat be nonsensical I had no idea what my role was. She ordered me to sit right in front of her at the top of the class and the second I opened my mouth she was down on me like a ton of bricks.","A few weeks ago i was in town and I bumped into an old maths teacher of mine.

"We went to my cousinas wedding. It was a lovely weddinga very unlike any wedding Iave yet been to, but a lot like the weddings in the movies (you know, like The Wedding Crashersa| never understood why someone would *want* to go to a wedding they werenat invited to). The ceremony was short and simple, though there were a lot of attendants, complete with flower girl and ring-bearer. The bride had both her father and step-father give her away, one on each arm. The Lutheran minister was kind of a jolly middle-aged woman. The gentlemen were almost all in army dress uniforms. From my cousinas face, you could not tell he was hit by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan just a few months ago. Heas still not walking correctly and never may, but the damage seems to mainly be concentrated in one leg.
 
 
 
 The wedding was in a part of the country where folks are not as stiff as Midwesterners or as unstructured as Northern Californians. Iave been to Midwestern wedding receptions that tried to be like this reception, but the soul wasnat there so they always ended up being kind of lame with folks congregated in the parking lot to talk away from the DJ. People at this wedding line-danced (and not just to country music) and they enjoyed it. My usually introverted uncle is apparently a dancing fiend and led the bride in some traditional dances. The food was great and full of local specialties (including something we heard about on the Splendid table from their road trip foodies). And, important in my book for any wedding, they served appetizers between the wedding and reception.
 
 
 
 You may recall that the groomas parents had said they refused to attend because he was not getting married by a priest. Not only did they not show up, despite his being hit by a roadside bomb in service to our country, they did not allow any siblings to come. The daughter whose college my parents and aunts are paying was threatened with being disowned when her mother found out she was planning to attend. So she didnat go. Guests kept asking if I was a sister. No, not a sister.
 
 
 
 But all of my aunts and uncles went, and I have a lot of aunts and uncles. It was funny to see all my uncles and my cousin and the characteristic ears of that side of the family. The family resemblance is especially strong with military haircuts. All my uncles are ex-military and they bonded with my cousinas army buddies. Not much has changed in the army in the past 30-40 years. SNAFUs still abound. My aunts talked about how the world has changed and wondered if the homophobic father of the groom realized his favorite aunt (after whom one of his daughters is named) was a lesbian. How nice it would have been if shead been around today and been able to share her relationship with her acompaniona out in the open.
 
 
 
 They openly wondered what had happened to my unclea head always been rigid and never had a sense of humor, but wasnat such a hater until he married his wife. Perhaps he could have been rigid and humorless for the powers of good if head married someone else. Ironically, the woman he married and is refusing to countenance this wedding is a divorced mother of threea| but the difference is that she got the Pope to annul that marriage, so somehow that made it ok. There was some speculation that perhaps the bride is better off with her mother-in-law not talking to her.
 
 
 
 My childless aunt and uncle took over duties of parents of the groom. The groom gave an especially moving speech about how grateful he was for his family to come and show the support they were showing. The bride sent a lovely thank-you note with the same sentiments. As the wedding party was breaking up for the folks having to catch planes, the bride and groom made plans to visit all of my aunts and uncles who live in interesting and accessible places. My family does take care of its own, even when some members refuse to.
 
 
 
 My cousin and his new wife are very nice people. I know they will have a lifetime of happiness together. And if their children and step-children are close with their great-aunts and uncles rather than their grandparents on my side of the family, well, thatas not such a bad thing.","We went to my cousinas wedding.

"As I swam through the shiny, shimmering Malaysian sea, a glimpse of black and white caught my eye. As I turned my head cautiously I saw a black and white puppy falling off a wet, slippery jetty. I watched it frighteningly fall into the wavy water. I looked very closely and saw the puppy was in a muddle; his small black head suddenly went under the water. I stood there watching it happen right in front of my eyes. I didnat know what to do, my mind was blank. Then my brain suddenly clicked it was like it was shouting at me. My mind yelled sympathetically. I swam with all my might. I knew the life of the puppy was in my hands. I dunked my head under the water and swam deeper and deeper until I reached the pup. Then I clenched my cold wet hands to his fur and pulled him above the water. Once we were back on shore I grabbed my towel and I wrapped it around him and checked if he was breathing or hurt. Unfortunately he was hurt, his little white paw was bleeding he probably cut it on a rock when he slipped. I presumed he was a lost pup. I told my parents the story about him and they let me keep him but they did say that they werenat going to take him back to Sydney. That night dad helped me build a kennel for him to sleep in. We also gave him a name I suggested. Ziggy.","As I swam through the shiny, shimmering Malaysian sea, a glimpse of black and white caught my eye.

"There are several joyful events in my life that I can summon up and out of those, I would like to talk about the day that my aunt was blessed with a little baby boy. This was an event that I still recall vibrantly.
 
 
 
 My aunt gave birth of the baby in a hospital. When I saw a little prince was crying on my aunt's lap I was like skimming that time. I was very contented when I heard my aunt is going to give a birth a baby. I got very animated and I was counting days when this baby will come. I speculated and anticipated lots of things I would do with the baby. On the day when the baby came into the world was one of the happiest days of my life.
 
 
 
 I usually used to go look after my aunt. After I went to the hospital to see the price, I was very glad and attached by the event. I heard a baby's crying voice and then went near the baby. For the first time in my life, I felt a strong desire to kiss and hug him. He was so cute and adorable. He was trying to open his little eyes. I thanked God for this precious gift because my uncle and aunt had no children for many years even after their desperate tries. They gave birth to the baby after 15 years of their marriage.
 
 
 
 My aunt asked me to hold him and kiss him. But I was so afraid to touch him as I thought that might hurt him. I felt I was in another world that time with the baby. After spending lots of time my parents were ready to go home but I denied returning home at night. I stayed in the hospital. This was a thrilling event for me.
 
 
 
 Now I have a great attachment to him. His first word was my name. But that time he didn't know who exactly he is calling! So this was the event that I like the most. It gives me lots of happiness and thatas why I cherish this memory very much","There are several joyful events in my life that I can summon up and out of those, I would like to talk about the day that my aunt was blessed with a little baby boy.
